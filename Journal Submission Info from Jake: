Journal Submission Info from Jake:

http://jacob.thebault-spieker.com/papers/TOCHI_SharingEconomy.pdf example of a journal paper that merges two studies together

(for context: submitting to a TOCHI, for instance, means that upon acceptance you still get to give a conference presentation, and even though conference submissions are where most CS submissions go, journals carry a similar level of prestige)
(and I can give you more suggestions about how to _present_ a paper that merges two studies together after I finish writing the talk for this one :wink: )
