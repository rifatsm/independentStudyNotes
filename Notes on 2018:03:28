Changes Needed to be Implemented:
- Color of the feedbacks based on the background needs discussion
- Let workers finish the Tutorial after half way through 
- MouseFlow free account on GT worker UI
- Stop reloading of worker UI page 
- Assign workers on the regions; once one region is finished move onto to the another. 
- Prioritize the regions regarding assigning workers. 
- Resize the minimap in the worker UI

- Geo-hashing - segments the whole earth in rectangles

Tentative schedule:
- Implement new changes in the GT system (by April 02, 2018)
- Test with the members of the research team (on April 02, 2018) 
- Run another pilot experiment with modified GT system (by April 05, 2018)
- Iterate the modification of the GT+LT system by getting feedback from the experts (semester long). 
- Automate the whole process (GT+LT) so that we do not need a developer present when we run the experiment.
- Publish it publicly online once the system is stable enough.

Requirements for making GT+LT a standalone system:
- Upload ground level image as well as diagram images
- Use the LT API in order to automate the whole worker population
- Store the final selected grid in the expert investigation
